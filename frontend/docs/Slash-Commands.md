# Slash Commands

[Slash Commands][slash-commands] are a new first-party way of using commands on
Discord. The available slash commands are listed here, many of which have
[normal command](Commands.md) parallels.

None of the parameters are listed on this page as Discord will provide a guide
of which parameter is required and which are optional. Unlike normal commands,
parameter order does not matter and can be used in any order.

?> Permissions, unless specified otherwise, require that both the bot and the
calling user must have the specified Discord permissions.

!> Slash Commands must be explicitly enabled on a server when the bot is joins.
If typing `/` in chat does not bring up a prompt to use these commands with the
bot, please use this [link][authorize] to authorize use of these commands. It is
not required to remove the bot from an existing server to authorize creating
slash commands, and may take up to an hour to propagate to the authorized
servers.

!> Slash Commands are currently in an open beta. There may be notable bugs or
unstable results when using them. If you have any issue using them, please
join the [support Discord](https://discord.gg/UydKWHX) for further support.
